    <p style="text-align: center; color: #666; margin-bottom: 30px;">Property Removal Authorization & Liability Waiver</p>

    <div style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">
        <p><strong>Company:</strong> JHE HAUL, operated by J Hunter Enterprises Inc. ("Company")<br>
        <strong>Platform:</strong> JHE HAUL mobile and web application ("Platform")<br>
        <strong>User:</strong> Customer requesting junk removal services ("Customer")<br>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> Upon job request or account creation</p>

        <hr style="margin: 20px 0;">

        <h3>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3>
        <p>By creating an account, posting a job, requesting service, scheduling an appointment, or communicating with a hauler through the Platform, the Customer agrees to these Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>Selecting "I Agree," "Book Job," or similar confirmation constitutes a legally binding electronic signature under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. §7001).</p>
        <p>If the Customer does not agree, they must not use the Platform.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 20px 0;">

        <h3>2. PLATFORM ROLE (VERY IMPORTANT)</h3>
        <p>JHE HAUL is a technology marketplace that connects Customers with independent junk removal service providers ("Haulers").</p>
        <p>The Company:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does NOT perform junk removal</li>
            <li>Does NOT employ the hauler</li>
            <li>Does NOT supervise the job</li>
            <li>Does NOT transport or dispose of property</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All junk removal services are performed by independent haulers, not by JHE HAUL.</p>
        <p>The service contract exists solely between the Customer and the Hauler.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 20px 0;">

        <h3>3. PROPERTY REMOVAL AUTHORIZATION</h3>
        <p>By posting a job and scheduling service, the Customer represents and warrants:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They are the legal owner of the property to be removed OR</li>
            <li>They have full legal authority and permission from the owner to authorize its removal.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Customer grants permission for the hauler to remove, haul away, and dispose of all items identified in the job listing, photographs, or present at the service location and designated for removal.</p>
        <p>Once removed, items may be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disposed</li>
            <li>Donated</li>
            <li>Recycled</li>
            <li>Resold</li>
            <li>Destroyed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Removed items cannot be returned.</strong></p>

        <hr style="margin: 20px 0;">

        <h3>4. WRONG ITEM / THEFT CLAIM PROTECTION</h3>
        <p>The Customer acknowledges:</p>
        <p><strong>Junk removal is irreversible.</strong></p>
        <p>The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring all items they wish to keep are removed from the removal area prior to the hauler's arrival.</p>
        <p>JHE HAUL and the Hauler are not responsible for accidentally removing items left within the designated junk area.</p>
        <p>The Customer waives any claim for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Theft</li>
            <li>Conversion</li>
            <li>Loss of sentimental value</li>
            <li>Mistaken removal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>after the hauler removes the items.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 20px 0;">

        <h3>5. TENANT, LANDLORD & THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY</h3>
