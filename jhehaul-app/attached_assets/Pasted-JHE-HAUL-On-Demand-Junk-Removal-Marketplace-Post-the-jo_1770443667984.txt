JHE HAUL

On-Demand Junk Removal Marketplace

Post the job. Get bids. Choose the price.

JHE HAUL is an app-based hauling service that connects customers with local, independent haulers ready to remove unwanted items quickly and professionally.
We act as the bridge between customers who need junk removed and haulers who are available to do the work.

Instead of calling around for quotes or overpaying for one company, you simply post what you need removed and receive multiple offers. You choose the hauler and price that fits your needs and your budget.

You’re in control from start to finish.
